        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In today’s digital world, cyber security threats pose significant risks to businesses across all industries. As organizations rely more on technology, it is important that employees know how to protect the company and themselves from risks. This report is designed to inform staff members on how to understand the main cybersecurity threats that the company faces and provide clear steps on how to prevent, identify and deal with these security issues. This report will focus on the key cybersecurity risks that could harm the company’s data, systems and operations. It will give you as employees practical advice on how to recognize and avoid cyberattacks. Additionally, this report will also discuss problems that might arise when handling cybersecurity issues and will suggest ways on how to deal with them. Through rising awareness and taking action, this program aims to empower every staff member to play a part in keeping the company safe and secure.</p>

        <h2>Main Body</h2>
        <h3>Risk Factors</h3>
        <p><strong>Malware:</strong> also known as malicious software, is designed to gain unauthorized access to one's computing device, such as a smartphone, laptop and/or personal computer, with the intention of doing what it was intended by the programmer. It can come in many forms, such as trying to gain personal/sensitive information, all the way to locking you out of your device until you meet their demands.</p>
        <p><strong>Phishing:</strong> Phishing is a fraudulent practice of gaining one’s personal information, whereby they send emails or some form of communication to the individual, posing as a reputable business or organisation. Individuals who fall into this trap have their personal information stolen and could end up in serious trouble.</p>
        <p><strong>Downloads:</strong> This is typically an unexpected form of malware, as it can attack the users with a simple click on a link or opening an email. The malware downloads itself on the device once the requirements are met, eg. clicking on an advertisement link to get more information on the product or opening an email/message.</p>
        <p><strong>Trojan Horse:</strong> One of the most difficult kinds of malware to identify is a trojan horse. They are designed to look authentic and perform the task required as intended. However, while doing this, they are breaching the security of the device.</p>
        <p><strong>Viruses:</strong> The most common type of malware is a virus. It’s a programme that has the capability to duplicate itself and normally has a detrimental effect. These could be corrupting the system or destroying data.</p>
        <p><strong>Ransomware:</strong> It is malware that is programmed to deny access to a computer system until a certain sum of money is paid. Ransomware can also be seen as a type of disturbed denial of service (DDoS). This is typically done through spam emails disguised as campaigns with links.</p>

        <h3>System Vulnerabilities</h3>
        <p>Once malware is present on the individual’s system, cybercriminals can exploit the existing vulnerabilities for their malicious intentions.</p>
        <p><strong>Hardware:</strong> It is considered the most manipulative system. In the event that the hardware were to be compromised, cybercriminals have the power and flexibility to launch security attacks.</p>
        <p><strong>Software:</strong> Cybercriminals use the flaws, gaps or system errors to make the software behave differently to its intended purpose.</p>
        <p><strong>Human Factor:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Insider Threats:</strong> These can be used by individuals who abuse their privileges to commit malicious acts. It is when someone within the insider of an organisation uses their authorized-intentionally or unintentionally-to compromise the organisation’s network or devices.</p>
