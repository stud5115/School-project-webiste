        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Being ahead of cyber threats is beneficial for the company. A IT Awareness Program is compulsory so the employees can have a broader understanding of the latest cybersecurity challenges. If now the employees have a broader understanding of cybersecurity challenges we can efficiently reduce the risk of cyber attacks and data breaches even though it's not a once off fix. This program would be an ongoing effort that requires regular updates, interactive engagement and open discussions. Employees working together on this with dedication helps the company to build a safer, more secure work environment for everyone.</p>
