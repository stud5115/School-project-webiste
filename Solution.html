        <h2>Solutions</h2>
        <p>Creating a strong IT Awareness Program would be for the benefit of everyone and also their information. In this particular program we would be keeping an eye out for suspicious activities within the company's cybersecurity so we can be able to detect and eliminate it before it reaches the organization's sensitive information. This program should align with the company's strategies, resources and initiatives within culture. Teamwork would ensure a working space where by everyone feels empowered to make smart.</p>
        <p>There are a lot of different strategies and resources. Some of those strategies include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Security Awareness Training:</strong> give employees regular security awareness training based on different security.</li>
            <li><strong>Security Ambassadors:</strong> each department appoints security ambassadors to enhance the development of security awareness and also practices within teams.</li>
            <li><strong>Gamification:</strong> incorporate interactive elements like quizzes and challenges to learning enjoyable, interactive and also effective ultimately reinforcing key concepts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These are the few strategies we can use. Now moving on to the resources. Some of the resources are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Security Awareness Training Modules:</strong> online security awareness training such as the ones given by SANS or KnowBe4 are utilized by employees to interact and also engage in security awareness training.</li>
            <li><strong>Security Newsletters and Blogs:</strong> provided by Cybersecurity Ventures whereby employees can subscribe so they stay informed of the latest security threats and trends.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We have covered the strategies and resources we will now be moving on as to how to incorporate educational initiatives into the company's culture. Initiatives including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Making security awareness a priority:</strong> we assign sufficient funds and budget to sustain the IT Awareness Program.</li>
            <li><strong>Senior management and leadership team members participating in awareness training and activities etc.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the modern society that we live in now there are a lot of different cybersecurity threats and solutions. Here are some of the threats and also their potential solutions.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Threat:</strong> Ransomware which is a malware that invades a victim's files and personal information then later demands a ransom for their decryption.
                <strong>Solution:</strong> The potential solution for this threat is to back up often and also keep all software and operating systems up to date.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Threat:</strong> Insider Threats which are threats caused by employees unintentionally so but then compromises security.
                <strong>Solution:</strong> To prevent/eliminate this threat we could use DLP to identify suspicious behavior.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Threat:</strong> Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), this threat basically causes service outages/disruptions by implementing traffic within the company's network.
                <strong>Solution:</strong> The company /organization could implement services that detect the DDoS attacks prior so that they can be minimized.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Being ahead of cyber threats is beneficial for the company. A IT Awareness Program is compulsory so the employees can have a broader understanding of the latest cybersecurity challenges. If now the employees have a broader understanding of cybersecurity challenges we can efficiently reduce the risk of cyber attacks and data breaches even though it's not a once off fix. This program would be an ongoing effort that requires regular updates, interactive engagement and open discussions. Employees working together on this with dedication helps the company to build a safer, more secure work environment for everyone.</p>
